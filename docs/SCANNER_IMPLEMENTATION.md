# Security Scanner Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the security scanner, focusing on OWASP Top 10 and common web application vulnerabilities. The scanner is designed to be generic and applicable to any web application, with Juice Shop serving as a reference implementation.

## Core Components

### 1. Scanner (`scanner.go`)
The main scanner implementation that orchestrates vulnerability checks and manages the scanning process.

### 2. Enhanced Scanner (`enhanced_checks.go`)
Provides additional scanning capabilities using external tools like ffuf, amass, httpx, and nuclei.

### 3. Evidence Collection
Collects and stores evidence of found vulnerabilities for reporting and verification.

## OWASP Coverage

### A1: Broken Access Control
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) testing
- Privilege escalation testing
- Directory traversal testing
- Missing access control testing

### A2: Cryptographic Failures
- Sensitive data exposure testing
- Weak encryption testing
- Missing HTTPS testing
- Cookie security testing

### A3: Injection
- SQL injection testing
- NoSQL injection testing
- Command injection testing
- LDAP injection testing

### A4: Insecure Design
- Business logic flaws testing
- Missing security controls testing
- Insecure defaults testing

### A5: Security Misconfiguration
- Default credentials testing
- Directory listing testing
- Verbose error messages testing
- Security headers testing

### A6: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Component version detection
- Known vulnerability checking
- Outdated library detection

### A7: Identification and Authentication Failures
- Weak password testing
- Session management testing
- Password reset flaws testing
- Multi-factor authentication testing

### A8: Software and Data Integrity Failures
- File upload testing
- Deserialization testing
- Integrity verification testing

### A9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Logging configuration testing
- Monitoring coverage testing
- Alert mechanism testing

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Internal service access testing
- Cloud metadata access testing
- Protocol smuggling testing

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Generic Approach
- Focus on common vulnerability patterns
- Use standard testing methodologies
- Avoid application-specific assumptions

### 2. Evidence Collection
- Collect HTTP requests and responses
- Store screenshots when relevant
- Document vulnerability details

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful failure handling
- Clear error messages
- Proper logging

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Respect rate limits
- Implement timeouts
- Optimize resource usage

## External Tools Integration

### 1. Fuzzing (ffuf)
- Directory/file discovery
- Parameter fuzzing
- Content discovery

### 2. Subdomain Enumeration (amass)
- Subdomain discovery
- DNS enumeration
- Passive reconnaissance

### 3. HTTP Probing (httpx)
- Service detection
- Technology fingerprinting
- Response analysis

### 4. Vulnerability Scanning (nuclei)
- Template-based scanning
- Known vulnerability detection
- Custom payload testing

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Design**
   - Keep checks independent
   - Easy to add new checks
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Evidence Collection**
   - Store all relevant data
   - Include reproduction steps
   - Document impact

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation
   - Clear error messages
   - Proper logging

4. **Performance**
   - Respect rate limits
   - Implement timeouts
   - Optimize resource usage

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional Checks**
   - XXE detection
   - Deserialization testing
   - Redirect testing
   - Anti-automation testing

2. **Enhanced Evidence**
   - Better screenshot capture
   - More detailed logging
   - Improved reporting

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel scanning
   - Caching
   - Resource management

4. **Documentation**
   - More detailed check descriptions
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guide
